## Backlog Tracker
### What Is This?
This is an application written in PHP, HTML, Javascript, and CSS to serve as a starting point for a backlog tracker.
This is designed to track issues, and display them in a tabular format for easy viewing.
### How To Run?
There is a docker-compose file to be run using the command line. This should pull in a full development environment with PHP, MySQL, and even PHP MyAdmin.
Table and database information will be provided soon. At the moment, this repository and be cloned, and viewing the code should give an idea as to the table structure.
